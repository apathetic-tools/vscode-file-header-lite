# DECISIONS.md

A record of major design and implementation decisions in **file-header** ‚Äî what was considered, what was chosen, and why.

Each entry should be:

- **Atomic:** one key decision per entry.
- **Dated:** include the date you made the call.
- **Rationale-focused:** emphasize _why_ something was done (or not done), not just _what_.

# Example

## [2025-10-07] Example: Don't Auto-Update Headers on File Rename

### Context

Auto-updating header paths sounded useful but caused confusion when the header diverged from intentional naming (e.g. generated or aliased files).

### Options Considered

- ‚úÖ Disable automatic updates by default
- üîÑ Enable by default with an opt-out
- ‚öôÔ∏è Make it configurable

### Decision

Set `autoUpdate = false` by default.

### Consequences

- Simplifies mental model ‚Äî users must explicitly choose to auto-update.
- Slightly less convenient for file renames, but avoids silent edits.
